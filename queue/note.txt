What is Queue?
  ... The queue data structure is sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO);
  ... The First element inserted in the queue is first element to be removed;
  ... The queue data structure supports two main operations
        a. Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
        b. Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection


What is circular Queue?
  ... The size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element.
  ... Also referred to as circular buffer or ring buffer and follows FIFO principle.
  ... A circular Queue will reuse the empty block created during the dequeue operation.
