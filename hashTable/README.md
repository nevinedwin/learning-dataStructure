# Hash Table

## 1. What is Hash Table?
    ... A hash Table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that is used  
        to store key-value pairs.  
    ... Given a key, we can associate a value with that key for very fast lookup.  
    ... Javascript's Object is a special implementation of the hash table data structure.  
        However, Object class adds its own keys Keys that we input may conflict and overwrite  
        the inheritied default properties.
